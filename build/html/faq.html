<div class="section" id="what-is-chips">
<h2>What is CHIPS?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-chips" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>CHIPS is a project started to be implemented in Komodo platform. It is currently one of the few coins that has SegWit and Lightning Network enabled. The objective is for this coin to be used in the Pangea Poker dAPP that is
currently being developed on Komodo Platform as well as allowing this project to be integrated into any other gaming or gambling system that may want to employ it as it actively supports micro-transactions and has exceptionally
low fees. Any service that needs to utilize micro-payments can also use CHIPS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-will-chips-be-used-in-the-komodo-platform">
<h2>How will CHIPS be used in the Komodo Platform?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-will-chips-be-used-in-the-komodo-platform" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>CHIPS will be the pioneer currency for the decentralized flagship gaming application “Pangea Poker”. Pangea Poker is a truly decentralized Texas hold ‘em game application. Komodo coins will be
exchangeable into CHIPS to be used in the poker game. This will facilitate truly fair decentralized and secured betting and gaming. CHIPS’s use cases don’t stop here though! Any other dAPP or online gaming project that would
like to utilize the platform is free to do so! CHIPS is a fair launch coin with no premine, allowing for lightning network to be implemented in a fully functional currency, easily adaptable to any online gaming or gambling
environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-does-chips-have-to-do-with-pangea-poker">
<h2>What does CHIPS have to do with Pangea Poker?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-chips-have-to-do-with-pangea-poker" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Although the coin itself doesn’t have a connection with Pangea from a technological point of view, the poker application will be the first focus of the coin’s usage. CHIPS will be the only currency that will be accepted in Pangea Poker – so initially it is going to be exclusive to that
decentralized application (dAPP).  Pangea poker will be run on the BET platform, which is the technology that will drive Komodo Platform’s gaming module.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-some-of-the-features-of-chips">
<h2>What are some of the features of CHIPS?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-some-of-the-features-of-chips" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Lightning Network enabled</p></li>
<li><p>Microtransactions – used for betting or any other micro-transaction application</p></li>
<li><p>Will be used widely in betting platforms within the Komodo Ecosystem</p></li>

<div class="section" id="what-algorithm-is-chips-based-on">
<h2>What algorithm is CHIPS based on?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-algorithm-is-chips-based-on" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>SHA-256 is used for the Proof-of-Work phase as CHIPS is almost a pure BTC fork with lightning network implemented. The block time is 10 seconds. At some point, the coin will switch from PoW to dPoW to ensure that there will never
be a lack of hashing power for facilitating poker games and to combat a lack of mining as a result from decreasing mining rewards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-the-maximum-amount-of-coins-for-chips">
<h2>What is the maximum amount of coins for CHIPS?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-maximum-amount-of-coins-for-chips" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As this is almost a pure BTC fork, the maximum supply is 21,000,000 coins. Just as BTC, this fork applies halvings starting from 50 Chips per block.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-there-a-block-explorer-for-chips">

<p>There are only about 10,000 CHIPS left for mining. Mining is almost not worth it anymore, a block reward is 0.09765625 at this time of writing and is declining fast.</p>

<div class="section" id="is-there-a-wallet-for-chips">
<h2>Is there a wallet for CHIPS?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-there-a-wallet-for-chips" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>CHIPS is supported in Agama and as Command Line Interface. CHIPS uses the same wallet addresses and private keys as Komodo addresses – so you can create a KMD paper wallet to also store your CHIPS until the integration is
finished.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="are-there-currently-any-bounties-available-for-this-project">
<h2>Are there currently any bounties available for this project?<a class="headerlink" href="#are-there-currently-any-bounties-available-for-this-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes!
The KMD and CHIPS team have open bounties for GUI (—–??????——–) devs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-will-chips-be-able-to-do">
<h2>What will CHIPS be able to do?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-will-chips-be-able-to-do" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the major functions of CHIPS is facilitating online gaming and betting through Komodo’s BET platform.
This will enable decentralized card shuffling by poker dealers for example. Or to avoid overbetting, electronic signatures will allow for locking funds in betting games. More information will be made available as the project develops.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-wasnt-there-more-publicity-for-the-launch">
<h2>Why wasn’t there more publicity for the launch?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-wasnt-there-more-publicity-for-the-launch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Initially this project was just a first step towards developing Pangea Poker. Now that it is coming to fruition, the coin needs to be spread and circulating to enable actual game playing and test the system.
Although Pangea Poker is still far from finished, it’s important to have CHIPS circulating to ensure fair distribution and wide dissemination. At the same time, we want to provide the possibility to integrate the technology into other gaming and betting platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-wasnt-there-an-airdrop-or-ico">
<h2>Why wasn’t there an Airdrop or ICO?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-wasnt-there-an-airdrop-or-ico" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>CHIPS was initially set up as a side project by the lead developer of Komodo Platform. As it has been in development for some time now, it was largely a question of when rather than if this coin would be created. Once the decision was made to actually move forward with CHIPS – jl777 wrote the code and deployed it, posting it on bitcointalk.org. The thread didn’t really get much attention until CHIPS was listed on Coinexchange.io in September of 2017.
jl777 felt that the appropriate way to allow for decentralized distribution of CHIPS would be a 100% no-premine coin that had an open and fair launch from the beginning, allowing miners to mine the coin as was done in the pre-ICO
crypto era. The idea is that if a pure mining launch coin was good enough for Bitcoin, it was good enough for this project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="where-is-the-roadmap-or-white-paper">
<h2>Where is the roadmap? Or white paper?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-is-the-roadmap-or-white-paper" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At this point there’s no roadmap nor white paper as not deemed necessary as long CHIPS is still in the active development phase without any marketing focus.
The closest thing to a whitepaper can be found here: <a class="reference external" href="https://supernet.org/en/resources/updates/chip-and-a-chair-let-s-use-bitcoin-s-lightning-network-to-create-a-poker-game">https://supernet.org/en/resources/updates/chip-and-a-chair-let-s-use-bitcoin-s-lightning-network-to-create-a-poker-game</a></p>

<div class="section" id="were-there-any-announcements">
<h2>Were there any announcements?<a class="headerlink" href="#were-there-any-announcements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There is the Bitcointalk thread as well as a post on SuperNET about the launch:

<div class="section" id="how-can-i-get-some-chips">
<h2>How can I get some CHIPS?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-can-i-get-some-chips" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Currently you can either mine CHIPS using some of the pools listed (only about 10,000 CHIPS left for mining) or buy them from exchanges such as coinexchange.io and BarterDEX, Komodo Platform’s exchange technology enabling atomic
swaps.
Coinexchange.io currently only offers BTC/CHIPS, but BarterDEX provides you with dozens of cryptocurrencies to exchange for CHIPS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-implement-lightning-network-right-now">
<h2>Why implement Lightning Network right now?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-implement-lightning-network-right-now" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Because no other coins have truly utilized the full potential of Lightning Network. We believe that implementing LN technology will not only increase efficiency and allow for very low fees, but also enable randomization to provide truly decentralized and fair gaming – such as for the flagship project, Pangea Poker.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="whats-the-current-status-of-chips-with-no-gui-wallet-and-no-poker-dapp">
<h2>What’s the current status of CHIPS, with no GUI wallet and no poker dAPP?<a class="headerlink" href="#whats-the-current-status-of-chips-with-no-gui-wallet-and-no-poker-dapp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It holds and hopefully appreciates in value!
Furthermore, it has the ability to be used by anyone for any technology that requires micro-transactions. As it is nearly a pure hard fork of bitcoin, implementation is easy for those who are familiar with development.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="will-the-chips-use-jumblr">
<h2>Will the CHIPS use Jumblr?<a class="headerlink" href="#will-the-chips-use-jumblr" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As it is part of Komodo Platform, Jumblr will be able to be used by trading CHIPS for KMD and then back into CHIPS, in- and outside of BarterDEX. This will increase anonymity as Jumblr employs Komodo as a closed system to prevent any leakage of private information.
BarterDEX will allow for any cryptocurrency, and eventually also fiat currencies, to be exchanged for CHIPS through atomic swaps.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="when-will-pangea-poker-be-ready">
<h2>When will Pangea Poker be ready?<a class="headerlink" href="#when-will-pangea-poker-be-ready" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At this point there is no estimated time frame. Currently the focus is on Agama Wallet and BarterDEX, allowing true private, secure, and safe dICOs. Once these technologies are up and running smoothly, development on the poker dAPP will begin with full force. After that, the community will be updated accordingly.</p>
</div>

<h2>Where can I find more marketing materials?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-can-i-find-more-marketing-materials" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Stay tuned for further announcements on the SuperNET bulletin board and SuperNET Slack channel. Currently there isn’t anything planned except for posting more technical details and neither is troubleshooting a priority for the team at this point. For the moment the team is focusing on completing Agama Wallet and BarterDEX and creating a fully functional ecosystem for other dAPPs.</p>
